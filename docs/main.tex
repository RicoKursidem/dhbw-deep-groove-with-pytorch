		\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
			
			\noindent Frederik Hardwig describes Exploratory Data Analysis (\ac{EDA}) as two thinks. As a Way of Thinking and a Method to work with data. 
			The Data Miner should always keep in mind, that you need to look for new Patterns that weren't expected, because they are the most interesting. It is important not trying to proof your own Thesis from before the Analyzing Process but to find new ones and always keep open to new findings. Also the Data Analyst should be skeptic towards Methods that compromise Data. If Data is summarized there will always be some loss of Information and the Hypothesis that will be based on these results will be not complete. To avoid this it is a good thing being skeptic towards compressed data. 
			As a Method, \ac{EDA} works with a lot of visualization to find patterns in Datasets. It is important not to confuse Data Analysis and Statistics. It is important to keep in mind that even the most used statistical Methods could have some hidden assumptions about the data. It is always suggested to use diagrams and other visual methods to display data to minimize errors resulting out of these assumptions.\cite{Hardwig:Explortory_Data_Analysis}
			
			\noindent \ac{EDA} tries to generate a understanding of the data and not to proof already stated Hypothesis. This contrasts the Initial Data Analysis (\ac{IDA}) where it is more common to look closely for findings that are needed to develop a modal and testing hypothesis. The goals of \ac{EDA} is to develop and evaluate Hypothesis, provide recommendations for statistical Techniques to support the analyzing process and provide Methods to collect more Data. It tries to find relationships between elements and get the main features of the data. 
			
			\noindent To achieve these goals it uses different Methods. Descriptive Statistics is used to get a overview of the Data and the structure of the data. It is very important to get a feeling for the data structure to get the most meaningful and efficient results. In \ref{fig:statistical_description} we can see the main statistical characteristics of a dataset, witch contains the top female chess players in the world by the Rating in Standard Chess games. We can see the number of fields, that are filled (count), the median of the value(mean) and the standard deviation(std). It also shows us the Maximum (max) and minimum (min) and the higher, lower and middle quantil (25\%, 75\%, 50\%).

				}
				\caption{statistical description of the data}
				\label{fig:statistical_description}
			\end{figure}
		
			\noindent To visualize these statistical Properties we can use a Box-Plot. In \ref{fig:boxplot} is the standard rating column of the data visualized. This method can also applied on all columns with a metric datatype. So we could do the same with the other rating fields and the year of birth, but the id doesn't make sense because it is an nominal field. 
			
			\begin{figure} [H]
				\centering
				\resizebox{\linewidth} {!} {
					\includegraphics{res/boxplot.png}
					
				}
				\caption{Box-Plot of the standard rating}
				\label{fig:boxplot}
			\end{figure}
		
			\noindent An other way to get more information over the data is to group it by nominal fields. In this example we can group the data by federation or title of the chess player. In \ref{fig:groupeby} are the median given grouped by the federation.
			
			\begin{figure} [H]
				\centering
				\resizebox{\linewidth} {!} {
					\includegraphics{res/groupby.png}
					
				}
				\caption{Group by the country and showing the median}
				\label{fig:groupeby}
			\end{figure}
			
			To explore the relationships of the fields in the data we need to reduce the dimensions of the data elements. in our case one element has  dimensions. The standard, rapid, blitz rating and also the players age. We need to dissect the four dimensions to two. To do this we plot every single field against every other in their own chart. These charts can be seen in \ref{fig:crosschart}. We can also add a fifth nominal field by coloring the data points according to the Title. The result of the chart matrix is symmetrical and the diagonal charts are the same values plotted against each other so we only need to look at one side of the matrix.
			
			\begin{figure} [H]
				\centering
				\resizebox{\linewidth} {!} {
					\includegraphics{res/crosschart.png}
					
				}
				\caption{Plotting every data field against each other}
				\label{fig:crosschart}
			\end{figure}
			
			\noindent Out of the Charts in \ref{fig:crosschart} we can also generate the linear Correlation of the fields. The closer to one or minus one the value is, the better the two fields correlate linear. So we can say that in our data, blitz and rapid rating correlate more linear than standard rating with the other both in our data. But there is more to think about in this assumption. The data shows only the Players with a standard rating above 1960 so there is a hard line in the data. This results in a incomplete model of reality and we need to include it into our result. 
			The hypothesis could be that the blitz and rapid ratings correlate linear, with a value of 0.878720, under the top Players with a standard rating above 1960.
			We cannot see non linear correlations in this matrix so we could oversee them.
